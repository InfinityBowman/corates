# Agent Instructions

This file contains critical instructions for Agents. For detailed patterns, see specialized rule files in this directory.

This project is CoRATES (Collaborative Research Appraisal Tool for Evidence Synthesis), a SolidJS-based web application deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

## Package Structure

The project is split into multiple packages under the `packages/` directory:

- `/web`: Frontend application built with SolidJS
- `/workers`: Backend services, API endpoints, and database migrations
- `/landing`: Marketing and landing site
- `/ui`: Shared UI component library built with Ark UI
- `/shared`: Shared TypeScript utilities and error definitions
- `/mcp`: MCP server for development tools and documentation

The web package is copied into the landing package during build and deployed as a single site on one worker.

Do not worry about migrations (client side or backend) unless specifically instructed. This project is not in production and has no users.

## Critical Rules

### Coding Standards

- **NEVER use emojis anywhere** - Not in code, comments, documentation, plan files, commit messages, or examples
- This includes unicode symbols, DO NOT USE unicode symbols or emojis anywhere
- For UI icons, use `solid-icons` library or SVGs only (never emojis)
- Prefer modern ES6+ syntax and features
- Use import aliases from jsconfig.json (see ui-components.mdc)
- Prefer config files over hardcoding values
- Place plans in `docs/plans/` directory
- Ensure browser compatibility (Safari is usually problematic)

### File Organization

- Keep files small, focused, and modular
- Extract large files into sub-modules or separate utilities
- Each file should handle one coherent responsibility
- Group related components in subdirectories with barrel exports

### Libraries (MUST USE)

- **Zod**: Schema and input validation (backend)
- **Drizzle ORM**: ALL database interactions and migrations
- **Better-Auth**: Authentication and user management
- **Ark UI**: UI components from `@corates/ui` package
- **solid-icons**: Icon library (e.g., `solid-icons/bi`, `solid-icons/fi`)

### Code Comments

Comments should not repeat what the code is saying. Instead, reserve comments for explaining **why** something is being done, or to provide context that is not obvious from the code itself.

```js
// Bad - narrates what the code does
retries += 1

// Good - explains why
// Some APIs occasionally return 500s on valid requests. We retry up to 3 times
// before surfacing an error.
retries += 1
```

**When to Comment:**

- To explain why a particular approach or workaround was chosen
- To clarify intent when the code could be misread or misunderstood
- To provide context from external systems, specs, or requirements
- To document assumptions, edge cases, or limitations

**When Not to Comment:**

- Don't narrate what the code is doing — the code already says that
- Don't duplicate function or variable names in plain English
- Don't leave stale comments that contradict the code
- Don't reference removed or obsolete code paths (e.g. "No longer uses X format")

### UI Components

**Ark UI components are in `@corates/ui` package, NOT in local components.**

```js
// CORRECT
import { Dialog, Select, Toast } from '@corates/ui';

// WRONG
import { Dialog } from '@/components/ark/Dialog.jsx';
```

See `ui-components.mdc` for detailed component usage patterns.
### Database Migrations

- All migrations go in a single file: `packages/workers/migrations/0001_init.sql`
- Do NOT create separate migration files (0002_xxx.sql, etc.)
- Edit the existing 0001_init.sql file directly

### SolidJS Critical Patterns

- **Do NOT prop-drill application state** - Import stores directly where needed
- **Do NOT destructure props** - Access `props.field` directly or wrap in function: `() => props.field`
- Shared state lives in external stores under `packages/web/src/stores/`
- Components should receive at most 1-5 props (local config only, not shared state)
- Use `createStore` for complex state objects
- Use `createMemo` for derived values
- Move business logic to stores, utilities, or primitives (not components)

See `solidjs.mdc` for detailed reactivity patterns and examples.

## Documentation

- **ALWAYS use Corates MCP tools or other MCP** for Better-Auth, Drizzle, Icons, linting, and Ark UI documentation
- Reference `style-guide.md` for UI styling guidelines
- Reference `docs/error-handling-guide.md` for error handling patterns
- See `TESTING.md` for testing guidelines (do NOT add tests unless asked)

## Specialized Rule Files

For detailed patterns, see:
- `solidjs.mdc` - Reactivity patterns, props, stores, primitives
- `api-routes.mdc` - API route patterns, validation, database operations
- `error-handling.mdc` - Error handling patterns (frontend + backend)
- `ui-components.mdc` - UI component imports and usage
- `workers.mdc` - Workers package specific patterns

## Additional Notes

- Cloudflare Pages is NOT used; only Cloudflare Workers
- Packages are under `packages/` directory with their own dependencies
- Path aliases are defined in `packages/web/jsconfig.json`
- Adjust documentation if your changes would affect any existing documentation
