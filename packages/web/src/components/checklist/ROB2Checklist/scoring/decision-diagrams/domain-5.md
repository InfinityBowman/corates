Domain 5: Risk of bias in selection of the reported result
Signalling questions Elaboration Response options
5.1 Were the data that
produced this result
analysed in accordance with
a pre-specified analysis plan
that was finalized before
unblinded outcome data
were available for analysis?

If the researchers’ pre-specified intentions are available in sufficient detail, then planned outcome
measurements and analyses can be compared with those presented in the published report(s). To
avoid the possibility of selection of the reported result, finalization of the analysis intentions must
precede availability of unblinded outcome data to the trial investigators.
Changes to analysis plans that were made before unblinded outcome data were available, or that
were clearly unrelated to the results (e.g. due to a broken machine making data collection impossible)
do not raise concerns about bias in selection of the reported result.

5.2. ... multiple eligible
outcome measurements
(e.g. scales, definitions,
time points) within the
outcome domain?

A particular outcome domain (i.e. a true state or endpoint of interest) may be measured in multiple
ways. For example, the domain pain may be measured using multiple scales (e.g. a visual analogue

scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire), each at multiple time points (e.g. 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-
treatment). If multiple measurements were made, but only one or a subset is reported on the basis of

the results (e.g. statistical significance), there is a high risk of bias in the fully reported result.
Attention should be restricted to outcome measurements that are eligible for consideration by the
RoB 2 tool user. For example, if only a result using a specific measurement scale is eligible for
inclusion in a meta-analysis (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and this is reported by the trial,
then there would not be an issue of selection even if this result was reported (on the basis of the
results) in preference to the result from a different measurement scale (e.g. Beck Depression
Inventory).
Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ if:
There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan)
that a domain was measured in multiple eligible ways, but data for only one or a subset of
measures is fully reported (without justification), and the fully reported result is likely to have been
selected on the basis of the results. Selection on the basis of the results can arise from a desire for
findings to be newsworthy, sufficiently noteworthy to merit publication, or to confirm a prior
hypothesis. For example, trialists who have a preconception, or vested interest in showing, that an

experimental intervention is beneficial may be inclined to report outcome measurements
selectively that are favourable to the experimental intervention.
Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ if:
There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan)
that all eligible reported results for the outcome domain correspond to all intended outcome
measurements.
or
There is only one possible way in which the outcome domain can be measured (hence there is no
opportunity to select from multiple measures).
or
Outcome measurements are inconsistent across different reports on the same trial, but the
trialists have provided the reason for the inconsistency and it is not related to the nature of the
results.
Answer ‘No information’ if:
Analysis intentions are not available, or the analysis intentions are not reported in sufficient detail to
enable an assessment, and there is more than one way in which the outcome domain could have
been measured.

5.3 ... multiple eligible
analyses of the data?

A particular outcome measurement may be analysed in multiple ways. Examples include: unadjusted
and adjusted models; final value vs change from baseline vs analysis of covariance; transformations of
variables; different definitions of composite outcomes (e.g. ‘major adverse event’); conversion of
continuously scaled outcome to categorical data with different cut-points; different sets of covariates
for adjustment; and different strategies for dealing with missing data. Application of multiple
methods generates multiple effect estimates for a specific outcome measurement. If multiple
estimates are generated but only one or a subset is reported on the basis of the results (e.g. statistical
significance), there is a high risk of bias in the fully reported result. Attention should be restricted to
analyses that are eligible for consideration by the RoB 2 tool user. For example, if only the result from
an analysis of post-intervention values is eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis (e.g. at 12 weeks
after randomization), and this is reported by the trial, then there would not be an issue of selection
even if this result was reported (on the basis of the results) in preference to the result from an
analysis of changes from baseline.
Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ if:

Optional: What is the
predicted direction of bias
due to selection of the
reported result?

If the likely direction of bias can be predicted, it is helpful to state this. The direction might be
characterized either as being towards (or away from) the null, or as being in favour of one of the
interventions.
