Preliminary considerations
Study design
 Individually-randomized parallel-group trial
 Cluster-randomized parallel-group trial
 Individually randomized cross-over (or other matched) trial
For the purposes of this assessment, the interventions being compared are defined as
Experimental: Comparator:

Specify which outcome is being assessed for risk of bias
Specify the numerical result being assessed. In case of multiple alternative
analyses being presented, specify the numeric result (e.g. RR = 1.52 (95% CI
0.83 to 2.77) and/or a reference (e.g. to a table, figure or paragraph) that
uniquely defines the result being assessed.
Is the review team’s aim for this result...?
 to assess the effect of assignment to intervention (the ‘intention-to-treat’ effect)
 to assess the effect of adhering to intervention (the ‘per-protocol’ effect)
If the aim is to assess the effect of adhering to intervention, select the deviations from intended intervention that should be addressed (at least one must be
checked):
 occurrence of non-protocol interventions
 failures in implementing the intervention that could have affected the outcome
 non-adherence to their assigned intervention by trial participants
