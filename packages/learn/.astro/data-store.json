  "# Evidence Synthesis Basics Evidence synthesis is a family of research methods used to combine\nfindings from multiple studies to answer specific research questions. ## Why Evidence Synthesis\nMatters Individual studies often provide incomplete or conflicting answers to research questions.\nEvidence synthesis helps by: - **Increasing statistical power** - Combining data from multiple\nstudies - **Resolving uncertainty** - Addressing conflicting findings - **Identifying patterns** -\nRevealing trends across studies - **Informing policy** - Providing robust evidence for\ndecision-making ## Types of Evidence Synthesis ### Systematic Reviews A systematic review uses\nexplicit, reproducible methods to: - Identify all relevant studies - Assess their quality -\nSynthesize their findings Key characteristics: - Pre-specified protocol - Comprehensive search\nstrategy - Explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria - Quality assessment of included studies ###\nMeta-Analysis A meta-analysis is a statistical technique that combines quantitative results from\nmultiple studies. It's often (but not always) part of a systematic review. Benefits: - Precise\neffect estimates - Exploration of heterogeneity - Subgroup analyses ### Other Types - **Scoping\nReviews** - Map available evidence on a topic - **Rapid Reviews** - Streamlined systematic reviews\nfor time-sensitive decisions - **Umbrella Reviews** - Reviews of existing systematic reviews -\n**Network Meta-Analysis** - Compare multiple interventions simultaneously ## The Systematic Review\nProcess 1. **Define the question** - Use frameworks like PICO 2. **Develop the protocol** -\nPre-register your methods 3. **Search for studies** - Multiple databases, grey literature 4.\n**Screen studies** - Title/abstract, then full text 5. **Extract data** - Using standardized forms\n6. **Assess quality** - Using tools like AMSTAR-2 7. **Synthesize findings** - Narrative or\nmeta-analysis 8. **Report results** - Following PRISMA guidelines ## Quality Assessment Tools\nDifferent tools are used for different study types: | Study Type | Tool | |------------|------| |\nSystematic Reviews | AMSTAR-2 | | Randomized Trials | Cochrane Risk of Bias | | Observational\nStudies | Newcastle-Ottawa Scale | | Diagnostic Studies | QUADAS-2 | ## Learn More - [AMSTAR-2\nOverview](/learn/docs/amstar2-overview) - [Conducting Your First\nReview](/learn/tutorials/first-review)",

  "# AMSTAR-2 Overview AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, version 2) is a\ncritical appraisal tool designed to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. ## What\nis AMSTAR-2? AMSTAR-2 was developed by Shea et al. (2017) as an updated version of the original\nAMSTAR tool. It's specifically designed for systematic reviews that include randomized or\nnon-randomized studies of healthcare interventions. ## The 16 AMSTAR-2 Items AMSTAR-2 consists of 16\nitems that assess different aspects of a systematic review's methodology: ### Critical Domains Seven\nitems are considered \"critical\" because weaknesses in these areas can seriously affect the validity\nof the review: 1. **Item 2** - Protocol registration 2. **Item 4** - Comprehensive literature search\n3. **Item 7** - Justification for excluding studies 4. **Item 9** - Risk of bias assessment 5.\n**Item 11** - Appropriate meta-analysis methods 6. **Item 13** - Consideration of risk of bias in\nconclusions 7. **Item 15** - Assessment of publication bias ### Non-Critical Domains The remaining\nnine items address important but less critical aspects of methodology. ## Confidence Ratings Based\non the assessment, reviews receive one of four confidence ratings: | Rating | Criteria |\n|--------|----------| | **High** | No or one non-critical weakness | | **Moderate** | More than one\nnon-critical weakness | | **Low** | One critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses | |\n**Critically Low** | More than one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses | ## Using\nAMSTAR-2 in CoRATES CoRATES provides a structured interface for completing AMSTAR-2 assessments: 1.\nEach question is presented with clear response options 2. Add notes to document your reasoning 3.\nThe system automatically calculates the overall confidence rating 4. Compare assessments between\nreviewers easily ## Best Practices - **Read the full paper** before starting the assessment -\n**Document your reasoning** using the notes field - **Be consistent** in how you interpret criteria\n- **Discuss disagreements** with co-reviewers to reach consensus ## References Shea BJ, Reeves BC,\nWells G, et al.
