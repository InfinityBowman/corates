Replace what’s in the tile “AMSTAR-2 checklists” tile section 

with

Appraisal Checklists
Guided implementations of leading quality and risk-of-bias appraisal tools, including all items and supporting guidance.

*Note- maybe we can have an area that lists the tools currently supported.

With 

Ready to streamline your evidence appraisal process?
Join a growing community of researchers who use CoRATES to streamline their evidence appraisal workflows and improve efficiency and transparency throughout the process.

Also need to add these important feature

Automatic Scoring
Generate study-level appraisal scores automatically, reducing manual work and eliminating calculation errors by applying scoring rules correctly every time.
Data Visualization
Instantly create study-level and across-study visuals for intuitive interpretation and publication-ready graphics of your appraisal results.
__________________________
Not sure if we can include this somewhere
While CoRATES is designed for research teams appraising studies for evidence reviews, its guided checklists and automatic scoring also make it valuable for:
Graduate students learning how to appraise study quality
Clinicians and practitioners needing quick, one-off appraisals
Faculty teaching appraisal or methodology courses
And then have a button that indicates that they can do this for free and invite them to do that.

Here is another piece that maybe we can do with the cool graphics/icons

ABOUT PAGE

Developed by a research synthesis expert and a software engineer and data scientist, CoRATES combines methodological expertise with modern software engineering to support rigorous evidence appraisal.
About CoRATES
Born out of real frustrations with the study appraisal process, including managing PDF or Word checklists, using multiple spreadsheets, applying complex scoring rules, and using separate visualization tools, CoRATES brings the entire workflow into one streamlined and collaborative space.
Our goal is simple: to support high-quality evidence synthesis by making study appraisal easier to manage and more reliable to complete.
Developed collaboratively by an expert in research synthesis and a software engineer and data scientist, CoRATES integrates methodological expertise with modern software design to support rigorous and trustworthy evidence synthesis.
Whether you are part of a systematic review team, teaching research methods, completing a one-off appraisal, or learning the fundamentals of study quality assessment, CoRATES can help you complete evidence appraisal in a more efficient and effective way.
CoRATES does not create new appraisal tools. Rather, it helps researchers use established and validated tools more effectively by providing intuitive workflows, guided checklists, support for double coding and consensus, automatic scoring, and clear visual summaries. Together, these features increase transparency and reduce the burden of managing information across paper and spreadsheets.
CoRATES is more than a checklist platform. It is an ecosystem built to support high-quality and efficient study appraisal at every level, from individual learners to professional review teams.

Who We Are
We are committed to developing a platform that not only addresses practical challenges, but also aligns with best practices to enhance the rigor and efficiency of evidence appraisal for research synthesis. By combining methodological expertise with modern software engineering, we designed a platform that makes study appraisal more organized, transparent, and reliable. Our shared goal is to build a platform grounded in rigor, supported by thoughtful design, and genuinely useful to researchers, students, clinicians, and teams. 
ABOUT BRANDY
Brandy is a research synthesist with extensive expertise in systematic review methodology and evidence appraisal. She completed her first systematic review as a Campbell Collaboration review during her PhD, reflecting her commitment to rigorous and transparent methods from the very beginning of her career. She has been actively involved with the Campbell Collaboration for over 15 years as an author and currently serves as Co-Chair and Editor of the Social Welfare Coordinating Group.
Over her career, Brandy has authored more than 30 systematic reviews and overviews, regularly teaches systematic review methods, supervises doctoral students conducting evidence syntheses, and supports research teams in developing high-quality, methodologically sound reviews. Her firsthand experience with the practical challenges of managing the study appraisal process shaped the vision for CoRATES and directly informed its emphasis on usability and methodological rigor.



ABOUT JACOB
Jacob is a software engineer and data scientist who focuses on designing clear, intuitive, and scalable software. With strengths in systems architecture, user interface design, and data visualization, he enjoys building tools that solve practical problems for real users. His early work visualizing risk-of-bias data for an overview of reviews sparked his interest in research synthesis processes, and he brings a strong commitment to creating thoughtful, high-quality user experiences. As the technical lead for CoRATES, Jacob built the platform from the ground up, translating methodological requirements into a modern, collaborative system. His software engineering expertise and attention to research workflows are central to the platform’s design and user experience.
